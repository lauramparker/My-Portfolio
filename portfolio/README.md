# My Portfolio

<h3><u>Title: My Portfolio<u></h3>
<h5><i>React JS<i></h5>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
     This project contains the website-- built with REACT JS NATIVE-- for my personal bio and development portfolio. The intent of the site is to promote my development portfolio and share relevant career experience (for the purpose of finding and securing employment opportunities as a web developer). The site utilizes Bootstrap components and utilities to create a consistent layout on each page that is reponsive to different viewport sizes. All 3 pages have a consistent navigation bar "navbar" from Bootstrap, frequent use of padding and margin utlities, and specific components relevant for that page (see details below).
